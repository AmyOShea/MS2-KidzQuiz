# Kidz Quiz

Kidz Quiz is an interactive website designed for children to test their knowledge. With COVID-19 meaning schools are shut, parents are having to find fun and interactive ways to teach their children while at home. A great way to do this is through game play. 

At this point in development, this will be aimed at children aged 7-8 yrs old and the questions will consist of Math, English, Geography, Science, Animals and General Knowledge. 

You can find the live site [here]().

## Design
### Overall Feel
The overall feel of this website is to emulate and old school classroom setting. While this setting could be seen as outdated, the imagery is instantly recognisable. 
### Colour Scheme
I'm sticking to a simple colour pallete to cause little to no distraction for a child to be able to focus. 
### Typography
To go with the school theme, I wanted a typface that would emulate the look of chalk on a board.
